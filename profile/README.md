The "Polaric Server" is mainly a web based service to present APRS tracking information on maps and where the information is updated in real-time. It was originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary search and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a server program (APRS daemon) and a web application. The project has a focus on the ability to run as a "offline" service, on interoperability and security.
